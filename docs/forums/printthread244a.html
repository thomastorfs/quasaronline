Just WHY?!<br>2) You can fire THROUGH UFO walls now, reaaaaally?<br>3) How come that floater can survive a heavy plasma blast at point blank range so well it simply kills the soldier who fires?<br>4) Why bother with anything but autofire? No point is there?<br>5) Why are the civilians so STUPID?! Stop running round in circles, and get the hell out of there....<br>6) .... I didn&#39;t say run straight onto the craft now, did I? How am I supposed to get the rest of the platoon out?<br>7) An entire craft of sarges and capts... erm.. those ranks sound a little screwy..<br>8) Why on earth would the commander of all XCOM forces get off the plane first? Asking for it if you ask me...<br>9) There&#39;s a research tree, not pick the route you want in order to get there...<br>10) How come it takes so long to heal your soldiers? Do they take a month&#39;s paid vacation as well as being treated?<br>11) Same goes for aircraft... what are they waiting for? Christmas?!<br><br><br>Probably more, will think of some more later.</div></td></tr></table><br><table class="tborder" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="1" border="0" width="100%"><tr><td class="page"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%"><tr valign="bottom"><td style="font-size:14pt">Kora</td><td class="smallfont" align="right">3rd April 2007 23:30</td></tr></table><hr><div><strong>Re: My pet hates</strong><br>&nbsp;</div><div>1) what&#39;s so bad about 80 items?<br>2) hell knows. But you as can see, ther are lots of holes on UFO walls. (bang-bang-bang) Now.<br>3) reflex roll 20+ :)<br>4) Heavy laser + aimed shot = 140% guarantee of a dead alien<br>5) well, because they were stupid enough not to get away during that day your skyranger flew to terror place :)<br>6) your favourite autofire :)<br>7) but it&#39;s cool to rule a couple of colonels :)<br>8) He plays real leader. :)<br>9) try &quot;Terror from the deep&quot; :)<br>10) That depends on their wound actually. Unless he has half of his body melted down by 3 direct plasma hits, he recovers in 3-5 days usually, if his HP&#39;s were restored at the battlefield, + 1 week per every fatal wound he had in combat.<br>11) well, have you ever seen engineers busy themselves with FIXING that aircraft they just build? look at these holes all around the hull! definetely, guarantee is null, it&#39;s soldier&#39;s business to repair their faulty crafts, if they cannot handle it properly.</div></td></tr></table><br><br><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%"><tr valign="top"><td class="smallfont"></td><td align="right"><div class="smallfont"></div></td></tr></table><p class="smallfont" align="center"><br></p></body></html>
