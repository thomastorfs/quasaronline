Problem was a pro modeler guy came in the team and the main programmer started positively discriminating him.<br>What i mostly liked was to give my ideas and and influence the style of the game and its dynamics.<br><br>If you could give me an insight of where the team is heading, what the teams doing now and what are the planned features, I would like to give my opinion and decide if i can be helpful :)<br><br>Thanks</div></td></tr></table><br><table class="tborder" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="1" border="0" width="100%"><tr><td class="page"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%"><tr valign="bottom"><td style="font-size:14pt">Vintage</td><td class="smallfont" align="right">11th November 2008 13:59</td></tr></table><hr><div><strong>Re: Hello</strong><br>&nbsp;</div><div>I believe this is rather a question than a suggestion.

This first milestone will consist of the core game engine and logic that is put to use in a model viewer. The model viewer creation will offer us the possibility to easily test and evaluate our work in a shorter development period. Development officially starts on 15 november.<br><br>Furthermore in this milestone, game engineers and architects will build the foundations for Milestone 2. The goal of that milestone can be seen once you've become a member. We do not want to spoil any surprises ;)<br><br>The general goals with requirements have been made 1 year in advance. This means that we have a deadline with fixed goals to reach within one year.<br><br>We are a team with professional endeavours. The Quasar community rules strictly forbid any form of discrimination, racism, vulgar, ... behaviour. Any team- or forummembers violating this agreement get a warning. Whenever that warning doesn't stop the person from violating the rules, he/she gets banned.<br><br>I hope this answers your question. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask them by creating a new thread in this subforum.<br><br><br><br>greets,<br><br>Vintage</div></td></tr></table><br><table class="tborder" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="1" border="0" width="100%"><tr><td class="page"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%"><tr valign="bottom"><td style="font-size:14pt">Yavor</td><td class="smallfont" align="right">12th November 2008 15:15</td></tr></table><hr><div><strong>Re: What's the current status and team direction?</strong><br>&nbsp;</div><div>Thanks for the reply :). As i understand it, milestone 1 is mostly for the programmers team.

Milestone 1 is just as important to programmers as it is to game engineers and artists. Writers and Sound artists are a little bit more on the background, yet they will create very important work as well during this period.<br><br>The design document and other game development assets are not publicly available at the moment. This will stay this way until the project has reached a strong level of maturity. The project's progress will be made visible on the website.</div></td></tr></table><br><table class="tborder" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="1" border="0" width="100%"><tr><td class="page"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%"><tr valign="bottom"><td style="font-size:14pt">Yavor</td><td class="smallfont" align="right">13th November 2008 18:57</td></tr></table><hr><div><strong>Re: What's the current status and team direction?</strong><br>&nbsp;</div><div>Ok thank you.</div></td></tr></table><br><br><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%"><tr valign="top"><td class="smallfont"></td><td align="right"><div class="smallfont"></div></td></tr></table><p class="smallfont" align="center"><br></p></body></html>
